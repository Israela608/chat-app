# Chat App

A simple group chat app

## How long did you spend on the coding test?

12 hours

## What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

I was supposed to completer these sections, but was unable because due to other appointments. I can complete it today, but it will be past the deadline
- Profile Setup Page; Nickname, photo (After registration and Login)
- Sender photo displaying in Chat page
- Click photo to view profile description
- I've not tested the notification part yet
- Display date at the start of each day of the Chats
- Firebase Analysis
- Some Code Clean ups

## How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

With flutter inspector, Dart Analysis, Firebase analytics and testing. Yes Flutter inspector, Dart Analysis and normal testing. Haven't used analytics that much

## What improvement would you suggest to the Firebase team if you had the chance?

- The documentation for the Firebase Cloud Messaging section is bad, and the way they deprecate features is horrible. I think they should improve on that 
- Setting up of the Notification part is still stressful. The CLI should take care of most of that part
